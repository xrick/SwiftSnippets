/*
Edit: Here is another way to do this task if you are going to use this functionality in multiple UIViewControllers:
*/
extension UIViewController {
    func hideKeyboardWhenTappedAround() {
        let tap: UITapGestureRecognizer = UITapGestureRecognizer(target: self, action: #selector(UIViewController.dismissKeyboard))
        tap.cancelsTouchesInView = false            
        view.addGestureRecognizer(tap)
    }

    func dismissKeyboard() {
        view.endEditing(true)
    }
}
//Now in every UIViewController, all you have to do is call this function:
override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()
    self.hideKeyboardWhenTappedAround() 
}
